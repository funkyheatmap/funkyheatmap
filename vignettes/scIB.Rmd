## Introduction

The [single-cell integration benchmarking (scIB)][scib] project was an effort to evaluate and compare the performance of methods for integrating single-cell RNA and ATAC sequencing datasets.
Many of the results were displayed using custom scripts to create visualisations similar to those produced by `funkyheatmap`.

In this vignette we will show how these figures can be reproduced using `funkyheatmap`.

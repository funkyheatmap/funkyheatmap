`funkyheatmap` is available as a standalone executable. The data formats
are very similar as the underlying R function. Instead of data frames
you should pass TSV files and instead of a named list (for the palettes)
you should pass a yaml file.

## Install

```bash
wget https://github.com/dynverse/funkyheatmap/releases/latest/download/executable.zip
unzip executable.zip -d funky_heatmap
```

In order for this to work, you need to have Docker and Bash installed (nothing else).


## View help

Run `--help` to get more information on the arguments of funky heatmap.

```bash
./funky_heatmap --help
```

## Example

We also processed the `mtcars` dataset and stored it as a tsv file.
To generate a plot with it, use the following commands:

```bash
./funky_heatmap --data funky_heatmap/example_data.tsv --output plot.pdf
```

    ℹ Could not find column 'id' in data. Using rownames as 'id'.
    ℹ No column info was provided, assuming all columns in `data` are to be plotted.
    ℹ Column info did not contain column `name`, using `id` to generate it.
    ℹ Column info did not contain information on which columns to plot, inferring from `data` types.
    ℹ Column info did not contain group information, assuming columns are ungrouped.
    ℹ Column info did not contain a column called 'palette', generating palettes based on the 'geom' column.
    ℹ Column info did not contain a column called 'options', generating ptions based on the 'geom' column.
    ℹ No row info was provided, assuming all rows in `data` are to be plotted.
    ℹ Row info did not contain group information, assuming rows are ungrouped.
    ℹ No palettes were provided, trying to automatically assign palettes.
    ℹ Palette named 'numerical_palette' was not defined. Assuming palette is numerical. Automatically selected palette 'Blues'.
